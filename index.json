This solution should be of high quality in order to avoid a negative impact on current services of operator.\nThe solution One of the proven ways to increase the income of the operator is addition of commercial advertising to the existing channels of communication with subscribers. To implement such a solution, we proposed implementation of mobile advertising platforms, which allows managing advertising campaigns, consisting of targeted advertising.

For this, operators of financial services were granted 16 licenses for the operation of mobile money. One of the main stipulated conditions was the use of basic mobile devices without access to the Internet, by using basic telecommunication technologies – SMS and USSD, which can operate on almost all mobile phones.\nThe solution The most difficult task in creating a system of money transfer via mobile phones is a need for the integration of mobile money transfer services with several mobile operators (there are four operators in Nigeria) and with numerous banks.\nThe project was implemented by our company together with a Nigerian partner. Our platform was used to develop systems and services for money remittance open platform. The platform provides “Develop once, works on all mobile operators” principle for USSD services. For transaction processing, integration with mobile operators and banks, as well as the collection of statistics we used our Service Delivery Platform. Using the platform in the development of the system has allowed to reduce labor costs for the development for more than 60%.\n At the moment the system is successfully exploited, showing a constant increase in the number of payment transactions.\n ","permalink":"https://ai-bridge.ch/portfolio/mobile_money/","tags":null,"title":"High-performance Mobile system for money transfers"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The client Beeline is a Russian telecommunications brand by OJSC VimpelCom.

The operator has 55.7 million subscribers.\nThe scope Previously, to make a money transfer, the subscribers of Beeline had to know details of the beneficiary – bank account number or the card and use SMS commands to send money. It was a long and cumbersome process. To make the service easy for customers and enhance its profitability for the operator, the Financial Products Development Department of PJSC “VimpelCom” has taken the initiative to implement this service on the basis of USSD menu in partnership with our company.\nThe solution As part of solving this task we developed and implemented a new mobile service “Beeline. Transfer”. Management of the service via USSD on the side of the sender-subscriber of Beeline, as well as SMS notifications generated by the system, were implemented on a Service Delivery Platform. On the financial side, the system is integrated with the Beeline Mobile Commerce platform, as well as with the partner bank.\nService is initiated by calling *135#, then the caller follows the instructions of interactive menus. Transfers can be performed from the personal account of the operator or with a credit card. The card has to be linked to the mobile phone number only once. The main convenience of the service is that users no longer need to know the account number or card information of the recipient. The user only need to know recipient’s phone number. The recipient can choose convenient way of receiving funds – to the phone account or to a bank card.\n As a result of the service implementation, Beeline’s monthly turnover of money transfers increased by 10%.

Parking control is realized with the help of SMS, USSD, mobile applications and parking machines. All remote control, as well as all SMS notifications generated by the system, were implemented by “Transport gateway” module based on Service Delivery Platform.\nOn the financial side, the system is integrated with mobile commerce (support of payments from accounts of top Russian mobile operators: MTS, Megafon, Beeline and Tele2), as well as popular payment systems (Qiwi, Svyaznoy, etc, and several banks.

The technological basis of the new system was USSD dialogue, which provided an opportunity for interactive communication of drivers with the system from any phone model and without the use of mobile data.\nIn short time, with the help of our Mobilizer and SDP platforms, we implemented the solution, which allows:\n Replace the use of smart cards for drivers’ mobile phones, which completely eliminates the cost of card issuance and maintenance of card reader infrastructure Conduct interactive communications between driver and the system by using a cell phone, which allows a quick check of fuel residual limit allocated to the vehicle and perform actions for refueling Refuel the vehicle without leaving the cab.
