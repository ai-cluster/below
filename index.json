MTS currently holds licences to provide mobile services in 81 out of 83 regions in Russia and the entire territories of Armenia, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan. The company has over 102.4 million subscribers.\nThe scope The challenge set by the mobile operator – the search and implementation of additional sources of income. This solution should be of high quality in order to avoid a negative impact on current services of operator.\nThe solution One of the proven ways to increase the income of the operator is addition of commercial advertising to the existing channels of communication with subscribers. To implement such a solution, we proposed implementation of mobile advertising platforms, which allows managing advertising campaigns, consisting of targeted advertising. The platform consists of the following our products and modules:\n SharpAds Personalization MAdv Clickthru Informer SMPP Proxy SMS/USSD centre   The platform was integrated in MTS network. Today, the monthly volume of processed transactions exceeds 1 billion.\n Advertising is added to the following channels:\n USSD balance inquiry service SMS notifications from a service “Who Called” and other similar services SMS distribution Mobile applications  All main types of targeting are implemented: sex, age, APRU, geo targeting, operational information on connected services, packages and options.\nIn the near future, integration with sources of operational data and expansion of supported channels in the direction of mobile internet and applications is planned. Those sources will identify the current interests of subscribers.\n","permalink":"https://ai-bridge.ch/portfolio/mts/","tags":null,"title":"Mobile advertising platform"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The client The Government of Moscow, the highest executive body of state authority of Moscow.\nThe scope It was necessary to make the service of managing and paying for parking simple and accessible both to visitors and residents of the city.\nThe Moscow City Government wanted to solve a complex task:\n Establish order on the streets by removing parked cars from places not intended for parking Reduce the amount of vehicles in the city (with the introduction of parking fees, many citizens began to choose alternative options of transportation around the city) To earn extra money for the city budget  The solution As a solution, we implemented the “Moscow Parking Space” system. Parking control is realized with the help of SMS, USSD, mobile applications and parking machines. All remote control, as well as all SMS notifications generated by the system, were implemented by “Transport gateway” module based on Service Delivery Platform.\nOn the financial side, the system is integrated with mobile commerce (support of payments from accounts of top Russian mobile operators: MTS, Megafon, Beeline and Tele2), as well as popular payment systems (Qiwi, Svyaznoy, etc, and several banks. Support for all financial transactions between the system and its environment, was implemented with the help of “Payment Gateway” module based on Service Delivery Platform.\nIn addition, we implemented specialized module “Parking API», designed to simplify the management of parking spaces for different customers.\nCurrently, the system services and processes:\n 53175 parking spaces 2 million incoming messages 7 million outbound messages 1.5 million payment transactions  Expansion of the system to the new territories is possible in the future, as well as using the system for gated and barrier parking spaces.\n","permalink":"https://ai-bridge.ch/portfolio/parking/","tags":null,"title":"Parking spaces control and payment processing system"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The client Alfa Bank, the corporate treasury of the Alfa Group, is the largest private commercial bank in Russia. It ranks among top 10 largest banks in terms of capital in Russia and Ukraine.\nAlfa Banking Group is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, with branch network consisting of 775 offices across Russia and abroad, includes a subsidiary bank in the Netherlands and financial subsidiaries in the United States, the United Kingdom and Cyprus, and employs approximately 22 thousand people.\nThe scope Leader in the field of remote banking services, Alfa Bank, has set the task to provide convenient mobile banking service not just to smartphone users but also to owners of conventional phones, which amounts to about 70% of all mobile devices in Russia.\nAlfa Bank asked to provide bank customers a convenient, fast and secure alternative to SMS bank, that doesn’t require subscribers to access the Internet. Among other reasons for implementing this project are: long waiting time in call center queues, rising costs of voice traffic and expenses on call centers maintenance.\nThe solution Unlike a smartphone app, where a user has to enter password every time, all you need to do is dial *142# and get access to your accounts almost immediately, even without access to the Internet. The app can be accessed in roaming without extra charges and need for 3G or LTE connection. Functionality includes:\n Balance check Mini bank statements Top-up mobile phone airtime from bank account Transactions and payments history Block debit and credit cards  Security is provided by using USSD technology, as well as additional verification by checking the number of SIM cards. In addition, on some operations users can set additional password. Flexible system management of portal allows Alfa Bank quickly include new functions, change the old ones, and implement on its base services that generate additional income for the bank.\nAlfa Bank received a fast and reliable USSD service portal for its subscribers. For example, when during a DDOS-attack all the servers of the bank were not available, the service “Alfa-Dialog” continued to work.\nAccording to observers of the portal Banki.ru, «”Alfa-Dialog” – Russia’s only complete USSD-banking system» (Banki.ru, 08/09/2015).\n The service has a monthly fee and brings the bank tens of millions of rubles a month.\n ","permalink":"https://ai-bridge.ch/portfolio/ussd_app/","tags":null,"title":"USSD app for management of bank accounts and credit cards without the Internet"}]
