[{"categories":null,"contents":"The client: Beeline is a Russian telecommunications brand by OJSC VimpelCom. BPJSC VimpelCom is the third-largest wireless and the second-largest telecom operator in Russia. Since 2009, OJSC VimpelCom has been a subsidiary of VimpelCom Ltd. which is based in Amsterdam. The operator has 55.7 million subscribers.\nThe scope Previously, to make a money transfer, the subscribers of Beeline had to know the details of the beneficiary – the bank account number or the card number – and use SMS commands to send money. It was a long and cumbersome process. To make the service easy for customers and enhance its profitability for the operator, the Financial Products Development Department of PJSC “VimpelCom” has taken the initiative to implement this service on the basis of an USSD menu in partnership with our company.\nThe solution As part of solving this task, we developed and implemented a new mobile service: “Beeline. Transfer”. The management of the service via USSD on the side of the sender/subscriber of Beeline, as well as SMS notifications generated by the system, were implemented on a Service Delivery Platform. On the financial side, the system is integrated with the Beeline Mobile Commerce platform as well as with the partner bank. Service is initiated by calling *135#. Then, the caller follows the instructions of the interactive menus. Transfers can be performed from the personal account of the operator or with a credit card. The card has to be linked to the mobile phone number only once. The main convenience of the service is that users no longer need to know the account number or card information of the recipient. The user only needs to know the recipient’s phone number. The recipient can choose convenient ways of receiving funds – to the phone account or to a bank card.\n As a result of the service implementation, Beeline’s monthly turnover of money transfers increased by 10%. An average transaction amount is $40.\n ","permalink":"https://below-technologies.ch/portfolio/money_transfer/","tags":null,"title":"Instant Money Transfer from a Mobile Account or a Bank Card"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The client: Mobile TeleSystems (MTS) is the leading telecommunications group in Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. MTS currently holds licenses to provide mobile services in 81 out of 83 regions in Russia as well as the entire territories of Armenia, Ukraine, Belarus, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. The company has over 102.4 million subscribers.\nThe scope The challenge set by the mobile operator was the search for and implementation of additional sources of income. This solution should be of high quality in order to avoid a negative impact on current services of the operator.\nThe solution One of the proven ways to increase the operator’s income is the addition of commercial advertising to the existing channels of the communication with subscribers. To implement such a solution, we proposed the implementation of mobile advertising platforms. This allows managing advertising campaigns, consisting of targeted advertising. The platform consists of our following products and modules:\n SharpAds Personalization MAdv Clickthru Informer SMPP Proxy SMS/USSD centre   The platform was integrated into the MTS network. Today, the monthly volume of processed transactions exceeds 1 billion.\n Advertising is added to the following channels:\n USSD balance inquiry service SMS notifications from a service “Who Called” and other similar services SMS distribution Mobile applications  All main types of targeting are implemented: sex, age, APRU, geo targeting, operational information on connected services, packages, and options.\nIn the near future, the integration with sources of operational data and the expansion of supported channels in the direction of mobile internet and applications are planned.

For this, operators of financial services were granted 16 licenses for the operation of mobile money. One of the main stipulated conditions was the use of basic mobile devices without access to the Internet, by using basic telecommunication technologies – SMS and USSD – which can operate on almost all mobile phones.\nThe solution The most difficult task in creating a system of money transfer via mobile phones is a need for the integration of mobile money transfer services with several mobile operators (there are four operators in Nigeria), and with numerous banks. The project was implemented by our company together with a Nigerian partner. Our platform was used to develop systems and services for a money remittance open platform. The platform provides a “develop once, and it works for all mobile operators” principle for USSD services. For transaction processing, integration with mobile operators and banks, as well as the collection of statistics, we used our Service Delivery Platform. Using the platform in the development of the system reduced labor costs for the development by more than 60%.\n At the moment, the system is successfully exploited, showing a constant increase in the number of payment transactions.\n ","permalink":"https://below-technologies.ch/portfolio/mobile_money/","tags":null,"title":"High-performance Mobile System for Money Transfers"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The client: The Government of Moscow, the highest executive body of state authority of Moscow.\nThe scope It was necessary to make the service of managing and paying for parking simple and accessible, both to visitors and residents of the city.\nThe Moscow City Government wanted to solve a complex task:\n To establish order in the streets by removing parked cars from places not intended for parking To reduce the number of vehicles in the city (with the introduction of parking fees, many citizens began to choose alternative options of transportation around the city) To earn extra money for the city budget  The solution As a solution, we implemented the “Moscow Parking Space” system. Parking control is realized with the help of SMS, USSD, mobile applications, and parking machines. All remote control, as well as all SMS notifications generated by the system, were implemented by the “Transport Gateway” module based on the Service Delivery Platform.\nOn the financial side, the system is integrated with mobile commerce (support of payments from accounts of top Russian mobile operators: MTS, Megafon, Beeline, and Tele2), as well as popular payment systems (Qiwi, Svyaznoy, etc, and several banks). Support for all financial transactions between the system and its environment was implemented with the help of the “Payment Gateway” module based on the Service Delivery Platform.\nIn addition, we implemented a specialized module, “Parking API», designed to simplify the management of parking spaces for different customers. Currently, the system services and processes:\n 53175 parking spaces 2 million incoming messages 7 million outbound messages 1.5 million payment transactions  An expansion of the system to the new territories is possible in the future, as well as using the system for gated and barrier parking spaces.\n","permalink":"https://below-technologies.ch/portfolio/parking/","tags":null,"title":"Parking Spaces Control and Payment Processing System"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The client: Regional gas station network, which operates in the Siberian Federal District, Russia.\nThe scope The regional gas station network operating in the Siberian Federal District was faced with a task of developing a system for corporate customers. The current system is based on the use of smart cards. The main disadvantages of this system were:\n Expenses related to the issuing of cards The need to install special card readers at gas stations and additional costs for their maintenance Drivers cannot check remaining balance on the card, it can be done only at the gas station with the reader No online statistics on fuel consumption, both on the side of the filling station company and on the side of corporate clients No functionality to change the operational limits of fuel allocated for specific vehicles  The solution The solution developed by our company allowed the use of mobile phones instead of smart cards to refuel and to contro fuel consumption. The technological basis of the new system was an USSD dialogue, which provided an opportunity for interactive communication of drivers with the system from any phone model and without the use of mobile data. Within a short time, with the help of our Mobilizer and SDP platforms, we implemented the solution. It allows to:\n Replace the use of smart cards for drivers’ mobile phones, which completely eliminates the cost of card issuance and the maintenance of card reader infrastructure Conduct interactive communications between the driver and the system by using a cell phone, which allows to quickly check the fuel residual limit allocated to the vehicle and to perform actions for refueling Refuel the vehicle without leaving the cab. Fuel type and volume can be set by the driver with the help of the USSD menu on his mobile phone Quickly get real-time information on fuel consumption and perform actions to limit consumption   The system has been field-tested and demonstrated its high efficiency.

This amounts to about 70% of all mobile devices in Russia.\nAlfa Bank asked to provide bank customers a convenient, fast, and secure alternative to SMS banking that doesn’t require subscribers to access the Internet. Among the reasons for implementing this project are: long waiting time in call center queues, rising costs of voice traffic, and expenses for call center maintenance.\nThe solution Unlike a smartphone app, where a user has to enter the password every time, all you need to do is dial *142# and you will get access to your accounts almost immediately, even without access to the Internet. The app can be accessed by roaming without extra charges and does not need a 3G or LTE connection. Its functionalities include:\n Balance check Mini bank statements Top-up mobile phone airtime from bank account Transactions and payments history Block debit and credit cards  Security is provided by using USSD technology, as well as additional verification by checking the numbers of SIM cards.

Eyeline Sharp Ads is an advertising engine which inserts ads in SMS and USSD mobile messages, selecting ads using customer profile that insures advertising relevance.\nWhen ads are mashed with useful services, advertisement, as in Google’s case, becomes relevant. In fact it is the only form of acceptable advertising on mobile phones. SMS and USSD communications channels insure the widest possible reach for your ads.\nIf you are considering a Balance Check service, or a Missed Call Alert service, or a CallBack service, do more by appending unobtrusive advertising to messages. It is better than TV!\n Eyeline Sharp Ads is designed to work with multiple services. For example, all services developed by Eyeline for operators (Ads-n-Balance, CallBack, Missed Calls Alert) can have rotating advertising messages supplied by Sharp Ads; Services are integrated with Eyeline Sharp Ads through TCP/IP transport and use a custom protocol designed to support effective communication; Sharp Ads uses various mobile delivery channels: SMS, USSD, RSS, Cell broadcast, WAP push, MMS; Advertising messages inserted by Sharp Ads can be targeted by region or by subscriber profile (preferences, past actions); If Sharp Ads is integrated with Eyeline Service Delivery Platform, service flows can be fully monitored, and Conversion Rate (ratio of sales to clicks) can be calculated, as well as Click-Through Rate and other statistics; Eyeline Sharp Ads is deployed in the network of the largest mobile operator of Russia, MobileTeleSystems.  TARGETING Sharp Ads can target ads. It works by storing a subscriber’s profile consisting of any pre-existing data (such as operator’s data or information regarding the person’s number) and any data about previous actions of subscriber (if communication with the subscriber is managed by Eyeline SDP). In particular, ads can be targeted by:\n Region and location   Often the mobile number of subscriber already gives enough information to target ads by region. If information about location is available (from an LBS engine or VLR processing program), ads can be sharpened by location.  2.Subscriber answers to questions\n Why not directly ask your customers questions using USSD or WAP (or Web)? Answers can provide a useful guide as to what ads are most likely to succeed.  3.Previous actions of subscriber\n Subscriber leaves a trail of past choices which, if properly recorded, can be used to infer consumer preferences.  4.Preferences of subscriber\n Once customer preferences are known, they can be stored in the profile and used for further communication. One example is to shield your business from those who can not stand advertising in general (by blacklisting them).
